    <hr />
        <h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
            <p>One of the most heartfelt films I have watched based <br />
             on a boy who learns to love himself again. 
             </p>
        <h3>Get Out</h3>
            <p>Phenomenal horror/thriller; Jordan Peele is great!
            </p>
        <h3>Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse</h3>
            <p>One of the best animated demonstrations I've ever seen.
            </p>
        <h3>Stand By Me</h3>
            <p>Very Nostalgiac for me. Great coming of age story when <br /> 
            I was going through a rough point in my teenage years.
            </p>
